Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After almost four years covering East Africa and parts of the Middle East for the largest news wire in Spanish (Agencia de Noticias EFE), in 2021 I embarked myself in learning how to code in order to write conclusive, impactful data-driven stories. 

In order to do a different kind of journalism. 

That's the reason I am currently doing a Master of Science in Data Journalism at Columbia University.
