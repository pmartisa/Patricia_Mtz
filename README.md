Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After 3+ years covering East Africa and Israel-Palestine for Agencia EFE, the major multimedia news agency in Spanish language and the world's fourth largest wire service, in 2021 I embarked myself in the process of learning how to code in order to write conclusive, impactful data-driven stories. 

In order to do a different kind of journalism. 

That's the reason I am currently doing a Master of Science in Data Journalism at Columbia University.
