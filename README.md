Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After 3+ years covering East Africa and Israel-Palestine for Agencia EFE, the major news wire in Spanish language, in 2021 I received a full-scholarship from La Caixa to study Data Journalism in order to be able to tell all those stories that otherwise would go untold.

In order to keep doing high quality, data-driven journalism. 

That's the reason I am currently doing a Master of Science in Data Journalism at Columbia University.
